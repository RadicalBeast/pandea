                        <p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">     Hello my name is Justin Huang, and I am a sophomore at Dublin High School. Growing up, my life has always revolved and circled around computes. Whatever it would be playing games with my friends, or doing research for school, I would spent most of my day around a computer. This is where my dedication to computer science came in. My familiarity with the computer has allowed a vehement interest for computer engineering to expand and grow. A goal of mine during the past few years was to learn coding for the computer and being able to apply that to my everyday life. In order to achieve, a considerable and abundant amount of time is obligatory to develop the skill of computer science. The same thing is needed to be said for taking engineering classes to help expand the knowledge of programming.</p>
                        <p style="text-indent: 2.0em;">   Some strengths and commitment that I have that is required to this career is dedication and hard work. All of this is required to succeed, even if it means to try over and over again. As shown in my work in school and outside of school, my dedication has gotten me far. My grades had always been on the honor roll, and I have made the swim team during my freshman year in high school. I also could play the piano, and am currently on level 7 in Certificate of Merit.</p> 
                        <p style="text-indent: 2.0em;"> There has been plentiful life lessons that I have learned along the way. Some include being careful and not giving up. Being careful always comes in handy, especially when it comes to reading and answering test questions. One small word could turn someone's whole grade lopsided. Another thing that I have learned is that there are other things than school that matter. Grades are just letters that makes one feel good about themselves. There are more things to life than worrying about good grades so one could get into a good college.</p>
