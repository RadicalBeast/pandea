                    <p>For this <a href ="https://ide.c9.io/legalavian/cse2-ly-j-python" target="_blank">project</a>, the assignment that we were given was to create a project that involves manipulating an image
                    according to the demands of the consumer. Our client wanted a political poster that is based off of gun control(pro). So we edited the given images with certain features. We added border, logo pasting, and rounded corners. All of these features
                    could be customized any way that they wished. So they could choose whatever option they would want for their political image. The design process that we chose to this was that one of us was the driver, the one who comes up with what to do,
                    and the other is the coder, and makes the code. We also spent considerable time debugging and looking for ways to better improve the overall look of the image. Overall, the project was a success in fullfilling the needs for our cilent.<p>

                    <p>For this <a href ="https://ide.c9.io/legalavian/cse2-ly-j-python" target="_blank">project</a>, my partner and I created a python project where we were required to use the python language to create a game that is solely cased on text. In addition, since this game
                    is suppose to be an adventure, it changes as the user makes their own unique choices. The theme that we chose was a societ era setting, with different weapons, enemies, and paths that one could take
                    along the way as they complete their objectives. My role in this task is that my partner and I decided to split up the work. One of us would be brainstorming ideas, the other would be coding. Or it 
                    goes the other way around. The brainstorming of ideas had taken several days, and so was the flow chart, which had helped map out the entire scheme of how the code runs and where it takes the user based on their actions
                    of this text adventure game. In addition, some of the functions in python were split up between my partner and I. Somethings that I take away from this project is that I realize the value of support and dependency that us individuals have on each other. And that dependency unites
                    us to help finish through. This project could not have been done by myself. I could not have done it with the collaboration and communication from my partner</p>

                    create a game by using a platform called scratch. We chose the genre of a zombie type horror game, and got to work. The most challenging part of the project was finding ideas
                    and knowing what to do. The project was tackled on with little to none prior experiance on Scratch. In order to solve this problem, we resorted to Googling on what to do for each certain 
                    situation. This project was a way for me to help demonstrate my brainstorming and logical thinking, in order to envision how the game turned out. I helped put together the cutscenes and part of the game. The overall product turned
                    our better than expected. All of the sprites ran smoothly, and the animation worked out to be great. </p>

                    my team chose was the problem to trash on the freeway, and we came up with the idea of a robotic sweeper that could save both time and money
                    for the city that uses it. In addition, I was assigned with designing and the final product. This was a challenging task, considering the fact that
                    there were many design obstacles that was needed to be overcome, such as sizing, safety, and being able to be adopted to certain enviorments. The final product that was
                    created was a robotic highway sweeper, who uses its main sweeper in the front to help guide and pick up trash along the highway. There are additional sweepers in the back to 
                    help clean up any remaining trash.</p>
